<p>Millions of riders and drivers share a set of Community Guidelines, holding 
each other accountable to do the right thing.</p>

 and our technology helps verify that they are wearing a face cover</p>
 <p>We want you to feel safe riding with Uber as our communities start to move again.
  That’s why we’re introducing our new Door-to-Door Safety Standard</p>
