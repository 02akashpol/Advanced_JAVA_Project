<h1>Rides and beyond</h1>
<p>In addition to giving riders a way to get from point A to point B, we're working to bring the future 
closer with self-driving technology and urban air transport, helping people order food quickly and affordably, 
removing barriers to healthcare, creating new freight-booking solutions, and helping companies provide 
a seamless employee travel experience.</p>

<h1>Sustainability</h1>
<p>Uber is committing to becoming a fully electric, zero-emission platform by 2040,
 with 100% of rides taking place in zero-emission vehicles, on public transit, or with 
 micromobility. It is our responsibility as the largest mobility platform in the world to
  more aggressively tackle the challenge of climate change. We will do this by offering 
  riders more ways to ride green, helping drivers go electric, making transparency a 
  priority and partnering with NGOs and the private sector to help expedite a clean
and just energy transition.</p>
